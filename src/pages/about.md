Hi, we're Fastmail!

We provide email service to people and organizations, and we use open software
and open standards to do it.  We believe that part of what has made the email
ecosystem successful and interesting is its standards-based architecture.
We’re deeply invested in open source and open standards, and we spend a lot of
our time each year working on improving the state of email and the open
internet.  This year, we’re hosting a get-together of people who make
significant contributions to the email ecosystem, especially IMAP clients and
servers.

If you maintain a significant piece of the IMAP world, like a major server or
client, you might have something to get out of this work.  Our hope is that
many of us can get together in one place and talk about what we can agree would
be the best steps to make email better.  There isn’t, yet, a carved-in-stone
agenda, but here’s what we expect we’ll be doing:

**When**: October 30th - November 2nd, all day

**Where**: Philadelphia, PA

**What**: We’ll talk about…

* what features (especially those already standardized) would give users a
  faster, more reliable experience if widely implemented
* what features would reduce network traffic, round trips, and other server
  cost if widely implemented
* what features are *not* yet standardized, but seem like the next thing
  everybody wants in their client — and how we can prioritize standardizing
  them
* how to begin leveraging JMAP without having to totally rewrite IMAP code,
  especially for server-pushed change notifications
* how to prepare for more widespread transition to OAuth and JMAP

We’ve got a list of RFCs and draft standards that we think make good talking
points to start, but we'd also love to hear from you in advance about what you
think are concrete improvements we could make.

If you want to attend, you can find more at the “[so you want to
attend](/attend/)” page.  If you want more information, just
[email](ehlo@makebetter.email) and ask!
