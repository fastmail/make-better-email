So you want to attend Make Better Email 2023?  Great!

First off, this event is by invitation only.  If you didn't get an invitation,
and you think you should have gotten one, you should [contact
us](ehlo@makebetter.email) and ask!  Tell us what service or software you work
on.  (Remember, we're [focusing on IMAP clients and servers](/about), this
time!)

If you have an invitation, it will say what you need to do:

* register at the event registration page
* book your travel and hotel for Philadelphia (be here October 30th through
  November 2nd!)
* write in with things you'd like to get on the agenda

We'd like to keep things small.  That means just one or two people per client
or server.  We're not planning on remote attendees by video conference right
now.  If you're invited but can't make it, we can keep you up to date over
email or chat.
