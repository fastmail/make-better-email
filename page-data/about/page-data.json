We believe that part of what has made the email\necosystem successful and interesting is its standards-based architecture.\nWe’re deeply invested in open source and open standards, and we spend a lot of\nour time each year working on improving the state of email and the open\ninternet.  This year, we’re hosting a get-together of people who make\nsignificant contributions to the email ecosystem, especially IMAP clients and\nservers.</p>\n<p>If you maintain a significant piece of the IMAP world, like a major server or\nclient, you might have something to get out of this work.  Our hope is that\nmany of us can get together in one place and talk about what we can agree would\nbe the best steps to make email better.  There isn’t, yet, a carved-in-stone\nagenda, but here’s what we expect we’ll be doing:</p>\n<p><strong>When</strong>: October 30th - November 1st, all day</p>\n<p><strong>Where</strong>: London, England</p>\n<p><strong>What</strong>: We’ll talk about…</p>\n<ul>\n<li>what features (especially those already standardized) would give users a\nfaster, more reliable experience if widely implemented</li>\n<li>what features would reduce network traffic, round trips, and other server\ncost if widely implemented</li>\n<li>what features are <em>not</em> yet standardized, but seem like the next thing\neverybody wants in their client — and how we can prioritize standardizing\nthem</li>\n<li>how to begin leveraging JMAP without having to totally rewrite IMAP code,\nespecially for server-pushed change notifications</li>\n<li>how to prepare for more widespread transition to OAuth and JMAP</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We’ve got a list of RFCs and draft standards that we think make good talking\npoints to start, but we'd also love to hear from you in advance about what you\nthink are concrete improvements we could make.</p>\n<p>If you want to attend, you can find more at the “<a href=\"/attend/\">so you want to\nattend</a>” page.  If you want more information, just\n<a href=\"ehlo@makebetter.email\">email</a> and ask!</p>","frontmatter":{"slug":"/about","title":"About"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"b0386c82-465c-568f-a3e4-25b0e99cdeb5","frontmatter__slug":"/about","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"about"}}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
